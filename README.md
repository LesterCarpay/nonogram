# nonogram
A tool that solves nonogram/picross puzzles.
First, the number of rows/columns should be put in. (>10 might take a long time)
Then, row for row, starting at the topmost row.
After that, the columns should be put in, from left to right.
Numbers in a row or column should always be put in from the number furthest away from the puzzle to the one closest to the puzzle (i.e. left to right for rows, top to bottom for columns).
Numbers should always be separated by a comma.
