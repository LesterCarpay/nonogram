# nonogram
A tool that solves nonogram/picross puzzles.
Run the program, fill in the number of rows and the number of columns of the puzzle (both between 3 and 25) in the popup
window, and a blank puzzle for that size will open. Now you can fill in the row and column specifications by clicking the
location of the specification and filling in the specification in the popup window. When all specifications have been filled in,
click solve repeatedly to gradually solve the puzzle. When you cannot click the button anymore, the puzzle is done.
